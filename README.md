# iridescent
Flat design is boring and bad. Design that makes you want to look at things is cool and good. This is a silly jam in css (and a tiny bit of svg) that makes a rainbow thing like this: <img width="814" alt="Screen Shot 2022-06-01 at 5 16 20 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5882423/171503426-0a83c5a0-884b-48c0-90de-fe241061a441.png">
I think rainbows are very cool. Also I animated it.

## Who should use this?
People who enjoy shiny things and want to extract the useful bits from the files here. I have not packaged this well.
